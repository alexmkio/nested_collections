# Nested Collections

## Within the `Examples` directory you will find files that correlate with the `Nested Collections` lesson. You will work within this repo during the class in breakout rooms. During the lesson the instructor will notify you on which file you will be working in.

## Set Up
- Clone this repo

## Making it run
- In each file you will see a collection
- Below that collection you will see commented out instructions on what you are trying to implement
- Write your code below the commented out instructions. These files will not implement tests so you will need to use a `p`
  before the code in order to print to your terminal.

  Example:
  ```ruby
  names = ["bob", "linda", "joe", "sally"]
  p names.upcase
  ```
- From the CLI (command line interface) type `ruby <filename.rb>`

  Example:
  ```ruby
  ruby warm_up.rb
  ```
